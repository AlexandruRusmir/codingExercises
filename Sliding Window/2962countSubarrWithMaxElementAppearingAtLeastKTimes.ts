/**
 * The line `result += nums.length - right;` in the provided solution is a clever way to count all the valid subarrays that include the maximum element appearing at least \(k\) times without having to enumerate each one explicitly. This line works in conjunction with the sliding window technique, where `left` and `right` pointers are used to maintain a window of elements from the original array.

Here's a breakdown of how and why this works:

1. **The Sliding Window:** The algorithm maintains a window `[left, right]` within the array `nums` that contains the maximum element appearing at least \(k\) times. This window is expanded by moving the `right` pointer and potentially shrunk by moving the `left` pointer.

2. **Counting Subarrays:** Whenever the condition of having the maximum element appearing at least \(k\) times is met (`count >= k`), the algorithm calculates the number of subarrays ending at `right` that can be formed.

3. **Why `nums.length - right` Works:**
   - **Right Pointer Position:** When `count >= k`, the current position of the `right` pointer is such that adding any elements to the right of `right` (i.e., extending the subarray further to the right) will still maintain the condition of the maximum element appearing at least \(k\) times within the subarray.
   - **Subarray Count Calculation:** The expression `nums.length - right` calculates how many elements are to the right of the current `right` pointer, inclusive. This represents the number of different ways you can extend the current subarray to the right while still meeting the condition.
   - **Adding to Result:** By adding `nums.length - right` to `result`, you're effectively counting all subarrays that start anywhere within `[left, right]` and extend up to any point from `right` to the end of the array. This works because for each position of `left`, every position of `right` from the current `right` to the end of the array forms a valid subarray.

In simpler terms, once you have a valid window that meets the condition, every extension of this window to the right forms a new valid subarray. The number of such extensions is precisely the number of elements to the right of `right`, hence the addition `nums.length - right`. This way, the algorithm ensures that all unique subarrays meeting the condition are counted, leveraging the properties of the sliding window.
